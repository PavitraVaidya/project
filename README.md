# 🛣 Self-Driving Car Direction Prediction  

This project implements a *deep learning model* to predict steering directions of a self-driving car based on *road images, enabling **autonomous navigation* using *computer vision techniques*.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts *steering directions (Left / Right / Straight)* from input road images.  
- Uses *Deep Learning + Computer Vision (OpenCV)* for real-time image analysis.  
- *Pygame simulation* for visualizing car movement.  
- Modular code design for easy extension.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- *Python* 🐍  
- *OpenCV* – Image preprocessing & feature extraction  
- *Pygame* – Simulation environment  
- *sys* – System interaction  
- *Machine Learning / Deep Learning* – Direction prediction model
